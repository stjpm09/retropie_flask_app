Final Project TODO:

    * You need to create a file called runcommand-onstart.sh in the folder /opt/retropie/configs/all/
    * This file contains #!/usr/bin/env bash and python3 <filepath>
    write python code to get the rom name and system, and write to a different file
    * Once this works, create a MySQL database
    * Write information to the database instead of the other file
    figure out how exactly data will be displayed and how complex we want to get involving the -onend script
    * Grab the information from the database using python code or a display software
    * Create documentation for everything
    * Create presentation
